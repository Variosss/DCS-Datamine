--[[ Designer Notes. This file defines the order the lessons are shown in the in-game list.
       Explanations:
  ["file"] = "FileName.miz", - obligatory field.
  ["name"] = _("New Name"), - optional. Provides a key for ext localization. If omitted the name is taken from miz in proper locale.
  ["description"] = _("New Description"), - optional. Works same as "name" field but for description.
